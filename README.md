2024 Bosch maze solver robotics competition
# Maze-Solving Robot Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Maze-Solving Robot project designed for the II. Maze Competition of 2024. This repository serves as a centralized hub for storing all project files related to the development and implementation of a robot capable of autonomously navigating through a maze. The competition aims to challenge teams in creating innovative, efficient, and well-designed robots that can navigate mazes with speed and precision.

## Competition Highlights
- **Objective:** The primary goal is for the robot to navigate from the starting point to the maze exit in the shortest time possible.
- **Categories:** In addition to speed, teams will be evaluated in the Design and Construction categories, emphasizing the importance of creative design, aesthetic appearance, and solid construction.

## Repository Purpose
This repository is organized to streamline collaboration, development, and documentation of the Maze-Solving Robot project. Here's what you can find in this repository:

### 1. **Documentation:**
   - Detailed documentation covering design decisions, algorithms, and technical specifications.
   - Reports on testing procedures, results, and any challenges faced during development.

### 2. **Source Code:**
   - Implementation of the robot's control software, algorithms for maze navigation, and any auxiliary scripts or tools.

### 3. **Hardware Design:**
   - CAD models, schematics, and other design files related to the physical construction of the robot.

### 4. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Records of testing procedures, simulations, and real-world performance evaluations.

### 5. **Resources:**
   - Any additional resources, reference materials, or external libraries used in the project.
